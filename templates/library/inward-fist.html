    <h3>Inward Fist</h3>
    <h4>Body Training</h4>
    <h5>Hands</h5>
    <p>
        An inward fist's hands are his weapons. Training hands increases the damage dealt by the character for all weapon
        attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
        NOTE: This does not affect the fist's energy attacks.
    </p>
    <h5>Torso</h5>
    <p>
        An inward fist's torso is the core of its defense. Training torso increases resistance to attacks. It represents a
        form of flat damage reduction.
    </p>
    <h5>Legs</h5>
    <p>
        An inward fist's legs are used as an alternate weapon. Training legs increases damage with kicks significantly, and
        makes ki-building kick moves like spinkick and shinkick more effective.
    </p>
    <h5>Arms</h5>
    <p>
        An inward fist's arms can be trained to increase elusiveness. Training arms increases the character's chances of
        blocking incoming attacks.
    </p>
    <h4>Disciplines</h4>
    <p>Discipine is split into 10 levels, with 6 abilities spread out between them. This means that sometimes, training a
        single discipline level does not grant access to a new ability.</p>
    <h5>1 Discipline: Truesight</h5>
    <p>By training their senses and awareness of the energies of chakra, the inward fist can detect things not seen by the
        physical eye alone.</p>
    <h5>4 Discipline: Levitation</h5>
    <p>Through focus, determination and sheer inner will, the inward fist can lift themselves from the shackles of the
        earth.</p>
    <h5>5 Discipline: Roundhouse</h5>
    <p>A simple but effective attack that can hit multiple enemies.</p>
    <h5>7 Discipline: Inner Fire</h5>
    <p>By turning their focus inward and allowing their ki to flow through their body, the inward fist can burn away
        impurities in the body.</p>
    <h5>8 Discipline: Pheonix Fire</h5>
    <p>The inward fist can train themselves to redirect their flow of ki, empowering their attacks at the cost of their
        speed.</p>
    <h5>9 Discipline: Dim-Mak</h5>
    <p>Using their knowledge of Ki in all things, the inward fist can use their own energy to throw off the alignment of
        energy in others, essentially poisoning their energy.</p>
    <h4>Ki</h4>
    <p>
        Ki represents the character's ability to generate and focus inner energies. It is split into 30 levels. Each Ki
        level from 10-30 represents a single combo attack. In combat, ki is built by using ki-building moves.
